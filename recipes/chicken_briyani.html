        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's
            typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties,
            or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the
            work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal
            variety to use.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Pound Basmati Rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion diced</li>
            <li>5 pod cardamon</li>
            <li>3 whole cloves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step to make dish</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in
                hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a
                paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions,
                garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and
                golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and
                turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover
                and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes
                are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot
                water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low
                heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should
                only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished
                cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce
                the gravy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander
                for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until
                golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground
                ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice
                and stir well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring
                to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
